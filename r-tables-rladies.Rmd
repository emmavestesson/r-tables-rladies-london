# Background

I am Senior Data Analyst at the Health Foundation and a PhD student at UCL and the Alan Turing Institute. This means that I spend a lot of my time writing papers and reports.

--

- I have been using ggplot2 to create plots for years but for a long time I was creating tables manually (ie exporting data to a csv file and formatting it)
- Switching to making publication ready tables in R really improved my workflow
- Copying and pasting from the R console is error prone
- Hours wasted on formatting only to find out that a table needs updating
- Switching to creating tables in R has saved me time and made paper writing easier

# Cross tabing
The simplest table is a cross table of two categorical variables
```{r}
penguins %>%
  tbl_cross(row = island, col = year) %>% 
  bold_levels()
```

---

# Summary statistics

Next let's look at `tbl_summary()` 
```{r}
penguins %>%
  select(bill_length_mm,body_mass_g) %>%
  tbl_summary(
    label = list(bill_length_mm = "Bill length")
  )
```



---
#  By species


```{r}
penguins %>%
  select(bill_length_mm, species, body_mass_g) %>%
  tbl_summary(by = species  ) 
```

---
#  Changing statistics


```{r}
penguins %>%
  select(bill_length_mm, species, body_mass_g) %>%
  tbl_summary(
    by = species,
    label = list(bill_length_mm = "Bill length (mm)", 
                 body_mass_g = "Body mass (g)" ),
  ) 
```



---
#  Prettyfying

```{r}
penguins %>%
  select(bill_length_mm, species, body_mass_g) %>%
  tbl_summary(
    by = species,
    label = list(bill_length_mm = "Bill length (mm)", 
                 body_mass_g = "Body mass (g)" ),
        statistic = list(bill_length_mm ~ "{median} ({p25}, {p75}), range {min}-{max}")
  ) %>% 
  italicize_labels() %>% 
  modify_caption('A pretty table with *penguin* **data**') 
```




---

# tbl_regression

```{r}

 m1 <- lm(body_mass_g ~ island, data = penguins) %>% 
  tbl_regression()

 m1

```
---

```{r}


 m1 %>% 
  add_glance_table()

```


---

# Combine tables

```{r}
 m2 <- lm(body_mass_g ~ island + sex, data = penguins) %>%
  tbl_regression()
 
 tbl_merge(list(m1,m2), tab_spanner = c('Model 1', 'Model 2') )
```



---
# Themes

Journals have different requirements


```{r}
theme_gtsummary_journal(journal = 'lancet')
trial %>%
  select(age, trt, marker) %>%
  tbl_summary(
    by = trt,
    label = list(age = "Patient Age")
  )

reset_gtsummary_theme()
```

---

# Inline text

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tbl1 <- trial %>%
  select(age, trt, marker) %>%
  tbl_summary(
    by = trt,
    label = list(age = "Patient Age")
  )

tbl1
```



`inline_text(tbl1, variable = age, column = 'stat_1', pattern = '{median}') `

The median age is `r inline_text(tbl1, variable = age, column = 'stat_1', pattern = '{median}') ` years


---

# A word of caution
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height="10%", out.width="73%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here('print_engines.png'))
```

---

# Why do we need gt? 

I mainly use it when the dataset is too big for gtsummary


Allows almost any type of formatting
