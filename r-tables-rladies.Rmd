# Background

I am Senior Data Analyst at the Health Foundation and a PhD student at UCL and the Alan Turing Institute. This means that I spend a lot of my time writing papers and reports.

--

- I have been using ggplot2 to create plots for years but for a long time I was creating tables manually (ie exporting data to a csv file and formatting it)

--

- Switching to making publication ready tables in R really improved my workflow!!!

--

- Copying and pasting from the R console is error prone

- No longer wasting hours on formatting extracted data only to find out that a table needs updating

# Cross tabing
The simplest table is a cross table of two categorical variables
```{r}
penguins %>%
  tbl_cross(row = island, col = year) %>% 
  bold_levels()
```

---

# Summary statistics

Next let's look at `tbl_summary()` 
```{r}
penguins %>%
  select(bill_length_mm,body_mass_g) %>%
  tbl_summary(
    label = list(bill_length_mm = "Bill length")
  )
```



---
#  By species


```{r}
penguins %>%
  select(bill_length_mm, species, body_mass_g) %>%
  tbl_summary(by = species  ) 
```

---
#  Changing statistics


```{r}
penguins %>%
  select(bill_length_mm, species, body_mass_g) %>%
  tbl_summary(
    by = species,
    label = list(bill_length_mm = "Bill length (mm)", 
                 body_mass_g = "Body mass (g)" ),
  ) 
```



---
#  Prettyfying

```{r}
penguins %>%
  select(bill_length_mm, species, body_mass_g) %>%
  tbl_summary(
    by = species,
    label = list(bill_length_mm = "Bill length (mm)", 
                 body_mass_g = "Body mass (g)" ),
        statistic = list(bill_length_mm ~ "{median} ({p25}, {p75}), range {min}-{max}")
  ) %>% 
  italicize_labels() %>% 
  modify_caption('A pretty table with *penguin* **data**') 
```




---

# Regressions
Use `tbl_regression()` to extract regression results
```{r}

 m1 <- lm(body_mass_g ~ island, data = penguins) %>% 
  tbl_regression()

 m1

```
---

```{r}


 m1 %>% 
  add_glance_table()

```


---

# Combine tables

```{r}
 m2 <- lm(body_mass_g ~ island + sex, data = penguins) %>%
  tbl_regression()
 
 tbl_merge(list(m1,m2), tab_spanner = c('Model 1', 'Model 2') )
```



---
# Themes

Journals have different requirements


```{r}
theme_gtsummary_journal(journal = 'lancet')
trial %>%
  select(age, trt, marker) %>%
  tbl_summary(
    by = trt,
    label = list(age = "Patient Age")
  )

reset_gtsummary_theme()
```

---

# Inline text

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tbl1 <- penguins %>%
  select(bill_length_mm, species, body_mass_g) %>%
  tbl_summary(by = species  ) %>% 
  add_overall(last = TRUE)


tbl1
```

--

`inline_text(tbl1, variable = bill_length_mm, column = 'stat_0', pattern = '{median}') `

The median bill length is `r inline_text(tbl1, variable = bill_length_mm, column = 'stat_0', pattern = '{median}') ` mm.


---

# A word of caution
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height="10%", out.width="73%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here('print_engines.png'))
```

# gt

---

# Why do we need gt? 

I mainly use gtsummary but gt is great when 

- the data is already in the right format

--

- the dataset is too big for gtsummary

--

- I want to make a lot of formatting changes

---

```{r}
penguins_summary<- penguins %>% 
  group_by(island) %>% 
  summarise(obs = n(), body_mass_g_mean = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE), male_p = mean(sex == 'male', na.rm = TRUE))

```

```{r}
penguins_summary %>% 
  gt()
```
---
# Clean up the values
```{r}
penguins_summary %>% 
  gt() %>% 
  fmt_integer(columns = body_mass_g_mean) %>% 
  fmt_percent(columns = male_p, decimals = 1)
  
```

---
# Format based on values

```{r}
penguins_summary %>% 
  gt() %>% 
  fmt_integer(columns = body_mass_g_mean) %>% 
  fmt_percent(columns = male_p, decimals = 1) %>% 
tab_style(style = cell_fill(color = "lightblue"),
    locations = cells_body(columns = body_mass_g_mean,
      rows = body_mass_g_mean >= 4500)
  ) %>% 
  tab_style(style = cell_text(color = "red", weight = "bold"),
    locations = cells_body(
      columns = male_p,
      rows = male_p < 0.5
    )
  )

```

# Where to learn more

This has been a quick tour of the parts of gt and gtsummary that I use but there is so much more functionality!
