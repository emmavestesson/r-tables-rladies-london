# Background

I am Senior Data Analyst at the Health Foundation and a PhD student at UCL and the Alan Turing Institute. This means that I spend a lot of my time writing papers and reports.

--

- I have been using ggplot2 to automate plot creation for years but for a long time I was creating tables manually
- Copying and pasting from the R console is error prone
- Hours wasted on formatting only to find out that a table needs updating
- Switching to creating tables in R has saved me time and made paper writing easier
